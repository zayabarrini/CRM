Subject: Collaboration Opportunity in Psychoanalysis and Digital Art

Dear {name},

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zaya Barrini, and I work at the intersection of psychoanalysis, cinema, and digital art. As a specialist in Lacanian psychoanalysis, I've developed courses, clinical programs, and creative projects that bridge theoretical frameworks with artistic expression.

I'm currently seeking meaningful collaborations with institutions and professionals engaged in:
- Psychoanalytic theory and practice
- Clinical supervision and research
- Experimental digital art projects

You can explore my work, including an ongoing project on the topology of the Klein Bottle and its psychoanalytic applications, at: zayabarrini.vercel.app

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaborations, which could include:
✓ Guest lectures or course development
✓ Clinical supervision partnerships
✓ Joint research initiatives
✓ Interdisciplinary art projects

Would you be available for a conversation in the coming weeks? I'm happy to accommodate your schedule.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Zaya Barrini

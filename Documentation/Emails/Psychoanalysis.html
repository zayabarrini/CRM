    <section class="intro">
        <p>Dear {name},</p>
        <p>I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zaya Barrini, and I work at the intersection of psychoanalysis, cinema, and digital art. As a specialist in Lacanian psychoanalysis, I've developed courses, clinical programs, and creative projects that bridge theoretical frameworks with artistic expression.</p>
    </section>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>I'm currently seeking meaningful collaborations with institutions and professionals engaged in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Psychoanalytic theory and practice</li>
            <li>Clinical supervision and research</li>
            <li>Experimental digital art projects</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>You can explore my work, including an ongoing project on the topology of the Klein Bottle and its psychoanalytic applications, at: <a href="https://zayabarrini.vercel.app" target="_blank">zayabarrini.vercel.app</a></p>
    
    <p>I would welcome the opportunity to discuss potential collaborations, which could include:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
        <li>Guest lectures or course development</li>
        <li>Clinical supervision partnerships</li>
        <li>Joint research initiatives</li>
        <li>Interdisciplinary art projects</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Would you be available for a conversation in the coming weeks? I'm happy to accommodate your schedule.</p>
